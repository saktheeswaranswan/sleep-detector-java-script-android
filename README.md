Sleep Detector
Sometimes, while a driver is driving vehicle during night times, he/she might doze off and can cause accident.
This project helps a person wake up when one's eyes starts to close by beeping an alarm.

This Project Uses Tensorflow-project to detect face and uses it to detect whether the eyes are opened/closed.
